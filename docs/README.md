# FlexTheme for HumHub

The first free configurable theme for HumHub

## Features

### Colors (under development)

Define your custom colors.
Currently the 7 main colors are configurable. But I am planning to make nearly all color variables configurable.

### Verified Accounts

Define varified accounts by entering their user IDs.
The verified icon (check-circle) is shown in
- user profiles
- posts
- comments
- people page

### Social Controls

**Comment Link**

Choose between the text "Comment" / "Reply" (default) and the comment icon or both.

**Like Link**

Similar to Comment Link. But for the icon you can decide between thumbs up (default), heart and star.
